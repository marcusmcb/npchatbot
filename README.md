### Serato "now playing" Chat Command for Twitch

The index.js file in this repo runs as a message listener for your Twitch channel (via tmi.js) and will display your currently playing track in Serato as a response to the !np command in the chat by scraping the most recent entry on your Serato profile's live playlist page.
